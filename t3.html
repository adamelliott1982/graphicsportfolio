            <h3>"The Decision"</h3>
            <p>The poster for this summer's big murder mystery thriller was made using layer masks.  This differs from the use of quick selections by providing a visual mask that helps create more precise outlines of the various subjects, resulting in better definition and more realism against the background.  In addition, the drop shadows have been turned into separate layers then adjusted their perspectives to create more realistic shadow angles.  The text effects are numerous and follow different paths to let the audience get to know the characters through text alone.</p>
            <h4>Lab 5 Requirements:</h4>
            <p>Create a movie poster.  Set at 72ppi.  Add vector shapes with 3 filters and text with text effects and warp effects.  Create a path for text to follow.  Use puppet on part of poster.  Add smart filter to part of poster.</p>
