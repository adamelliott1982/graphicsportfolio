            <h3>"Cat Fancy Magazine"</h3>
            <p>This epic magazine cover was created by using a variety of selection tools.  The portrait's various subjects were selected and cut out by using a combination of quick select, object select, and the magnetic lasso tool.  In addition, the text layers contain different styles and are placed on different layers to provide more dimension to the cover and create a sense of immersion.</p>
