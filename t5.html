            <h3>"Adam Hates Yoga"</h3>
            <p>For those who hate exercise, there will always be Adam Hates Yoga.  This video was created by importing various clips and photos, then applying numerous techniques to achieve the desired result.  After the clips were shortened to the proper length, a black and white filter was applied to certain segments as well as panning and zooming effects.  Next, text and soud effects were added along with background music to bring a sense of flow, and finally the transition blends and fade out were applied to bring it all together.</p>
            <h4>Lab 7 Requirements:</h4>
            <p>Make a video 1-2 minutes long.  Add audio and at least one effect.</p>
