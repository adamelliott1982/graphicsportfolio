        <h3>"Natural Photobomb"</h3>
        <p>This natural photobomb was edited using two different tools.  The patch tool was used to select the giraffe/branch area and was dragged over to the left to provide basic coverage.  Next, the clone stamp tool was utilized in a stamping pattern instead of dragging to provide coverage around the outline of the replaced area.</p>
        <h4>Lab 1C Requirements:</h4>
        <p>Pick a photo which needs part of it to be removed.  Use content aware patch tool and/or clone tool.</p>
